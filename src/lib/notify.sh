# Two paths exist:
#   * live   - somebody has a graphical session, so notify-send is run inside
#              it via runuser with the session bus address set;
#   * queued - nobody is logged in, so the message is appended to a spool that
#              the XDG autostart entry replays at the next login.
#
# Messages travel as a msgid plus printf arguments rather than as finished
# text, so a notification queued at 04:00 is still rendered in whatever locale
# the user's desktop turns out to be running in.

# linger=yes keeps the message on screen until somebody dismisses it; anything
# else lets it time out on its own. The line it draws is whether the machine
# still needs a person: a finished update is over and done with and should not
# have to be clicked away, while a failure, a paused queue or a package that
# had to be skipped is only ever seen if it waits.
#
# Set explicitly rather than left to the server. Notification daemons do keep
# critical-urgency messages up - the spec asks them to, and Plasma obliges -
# but that is a "should", it says nothing about the normal-urgency messages
# here that still need somebody to act, and urgency separately controls sound
# and whether do-not-disturb is overridden. Those are not the same question.
#
# A tag means "at most one bubble of this kind on screen at a time": the
# previous one carrying the same tag is withdrawn first, so "installing
# updates" gives way to "system updated" instead of leaving two messages that
# contradict each other.
#
# Withdraw-then-post rather than the obvious --replace-id, because replacing
# only works while the old bubble is still on screen. Plasma's server drops a
# Notify() whose replaces_id names an expired notification: no bubble, no
# error, and the id it hands back is the dead one it just ignored. An update
# run lasts minutes and the start bubble times out after seconds, so the
# finished message landed in exactly that hole and was never seen. Closing an
# id that is already gone is a no-op, which makes this safe either way.
#
# queue=no is for messages that only mean anything while somebody is looking.
# Telling a user at next login that an update started an hour ago is noise.
