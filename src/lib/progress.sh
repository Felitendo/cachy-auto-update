# An unattended upgrade can take twenty minutes, and for most of that a user is
# told only that "an update is running". This drives the desktop's job list -
# the same widget that shows a bar while Dolphin copies files - so how far
# along the run is stays visible the whole time.
#
# The desktop ends the progress entry as soon as the D-Bus connection that
# asked for it goes away, which no one-shot bus client can survive. So an
# actual process per session holds that connection open and takes instructions
# on stdin; see cachy-auto-update-progress. Everything below is the writing end
# of those pipes, plus the arithmetic that turns "package 120 of 260 in the
# repository step" into one number for the bar.
#
# Absent anywhere along the way - no session, no Plasma, no Python bindings -
# this does nothing at all and the update proceeds exactly as before.
