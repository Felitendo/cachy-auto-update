# manager at any time and must never see a lock error caused by us. We can only
# guarantee that in one direction - by never *starting* while somebody else is
# mid-transaction - so the checks here run before anything is touched, and a
# refusal simply defers the run to the next hourly tick.

# Package managers that take /var/lib/pacman/db.lck. checkupdates is absent on
# purpose: it works against a private temporary database and never touches the
