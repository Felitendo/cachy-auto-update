# AppImages have no package manager of their own; Gear Lever is what tracks
# where each one came from and how to fetch a new build. Its CLI is a first
# class interface - `--update --all -y` is exactly the unattended entry point
# we need, and it skips AppImages whose application is currently running rather
# than pulling the file out from under it (we deliberately do not pass
# --force).
#
# This only runs for users with a live graphical session: Gear Lever is a
# Flatpak GTK application and needs the session's runtime directory. Nothing is
# lost by waiting - the next hourly tick will catch it once they log in.
