# _cau_pacman_progress_watch <logfile>
# Feeds the desktop's progress bar by watching pacman work, through both of the
# phases a pacman run has: first everything is fetched, then everything is
# unpacked. They are two steps on the bar rather than one, because they are two
# steps to sit through - a run that has been "installing updates" at 4% for six
# minutes has not hung, it is still downloading, and the bar should say so.
#
# In the transaction, pacman announces each package twice over, in one of two
# shapes, and which one depends on a flag this program sets itself:
#
#   upgrading glibc...              with --noprogressbar, i.e. every timer run
#   ( 12/218) upgrading glibc [##]  with the bar, i.e. an interactive `run`
#
# Only the second carries a counter, and the unattended runs that this bar
# exists for are exactly the ones that do not get it. So the position is
# counted here instead - one line per package - and the total taken from the
# "Package (218)" header pacman prints before it starts. That header is the
# better number anyway: checkupdates counts packages with an update available
# and knows nothing about the new dependencies pulled in alongside them.
#
# What must not be counted is the other (n/m) sequence pacman prints, for
# hooks and for checking keys, integrity and file conflicts. Each of those runs
# up to its own total, so following them would drive the bar to the end several
# times before the first package was unpacked. Requiring one of the verbs above
# is what excludes them.
#
# Read by polling the log rather than from a pipe: the log is written either by
# pacman directly or through tee depending on whether a person is watching, and
# one reader that works for both is worth the second of latency it costs.
